Hi! I'm a J.D./Ph.D. student at Stanford Law School and Stanford Political Science. I graduated as valedictorian from Dartmouth College in 2022 with a triple major in Government, Environmental Studies, and Quantitative Social Science.

My empirical research has appeared in journals such as <i>Nature Communications</i> and <i>Energy Research & Social Science</i>, and my legal scholarship has been published in the <i>Stanford Law Review</i> and the <i>University of Illinois Law Review</i>. <!--I also publish in peer-reviewed computer science venues, including <i>ACM Computer Science & Law</i> and <i>ACM FAccT</i> (Best Paper Award).--> My other writing has appeared in outlets such as the <i>London School of Economics USAPP</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i>.
